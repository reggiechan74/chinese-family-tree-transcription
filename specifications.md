# Chinese Family Tree Processing System Specifications

## System Overview

The Chinese Family Tree Processing System is a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline designed to process, analyze, and translate Chinese family tree images using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). The system employs a parallel validation approach in early stages followed by specialized processing in later stages.

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required API keys:
  - OpenAI API key (GPT-4/Vision)
  - Anthropic API key (Claude-2)
  - Google API key (Gemini Pro)
  - Groq API key
- Sufficient disk space for image processing and output storage
- Memory requirements based on image size and processing needs

### Dependencies
- PIL/Pillow for image processing
- OpenAI API client
- Anthropic API client
- Google GenerativeAI client
- Groq API client
- Additional utilities as specified in requirements.txt

## Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Initial Transcription (Parallel)
- **Purpose**: Generate initial independent transcriptions from image
- **Models**: LLM1, LLM2, LLM3 working in parallel
- **Input**: Raw image file
- **Output**: Three independent transcriptions (one from each model)
- **Validation**: Non-empty content verification
- **Note**: Independent operation, no cross-model communication

**Pseudocode**:
```python
def stage1_initial_transcription(image_path):
    # Initialize models in parallel
    models = [LLM1(), LLM2(), LLM3()]
    transcriptions = []
    
    # Process image in parallel
    for model in models:
        transcription = model.generate_transcription(image_path)
        validate_transcription(transcription)
        transcriptions.append(transcription)
    
    return transcriptions
```

### Stage 2: Secondary Transcription (Parallel)
- **Purpose**: Generate second set of independent transcriptions
- **Models**: LLM1, LLM2, LLM3 working in parallel
- **Input**: Same image file
- **Output**: Three additional independent transcriptions
- **Validation**: Content verification
- **Note**: Independent from Stage 1, provides second perspective

**Pseudocode**:
```python
def stage2_secondary_transcription(image_path):
    # Use same models for second pass
    models = [LLM1(), LLM2(), LLM3()]
    transcriptions = []
    
    # Generate second set of transcriptions
    for model in models:
        transcription = model.generate_transcription(image_path)
        validate_transcription(transcription)
        transcriptions.append(transcription)
    
    return transcriptions
```

### Stage 3: Analysis and Recommendations (Parallel)
- **Purpose**: Each model analyzes its own Stage 1 vs Stage 2 transcriptions
- **Models**: LLM1, LLM2, LLM3 working in parallel
- **Input**: Each model analyzes its respective pair of transcriptions
- **Output**: Three sets of analysis and recommendations
- **Validation**: Analysis completeness verification
- **Note**: Each model focuses on reconciling its own transcription differences

**Pseudocode**:
```python
def stage3_analysis(stage1_results, stage2_results):
    analyses = []
    
    # Each model analyzes its own transcriptions
    for i, model in enumerate([LLM1(), LLM2(), LLM3()]):
        analysis = model.analyze_context(
            stage1_results[i],
            stage2_results[i]
        )
        validate_analysis(analysis)
        analyses.append(analysis)
    
    return analyses
```

### Stage 4: Comprehensive Review (Parallel)
- **Purpose**: Each model performs comprehensive review of all previous data
- **Models**: LLM1, LLM2, LLM3 working in parallel
- **Input**: 
  * All Stage 1 transcriptions from all models
  * All Stage 2 transcriptions from all models
  * All Stage 3 analyses and recommendations
- **Output**: Three comprehensive reviews
- **Validation**: Complete review verification
- **Note**: Each model has full access to all previous transcriptions and analyses

**Pseudocode**:
```python
def stage4_comprehensive_review(stage1_results, stage2_results, stage3_analyses):
    reviews = []
    
    # Each model reviews all previous data
    for model in [LLM1(), LLM2(), LLM3()]:
        review = model.comprehensive_review(
            stage1_results,
            stage2_results,
            stage3_analyses
        )
        validate_review(review)
        reviews.append(review)
    
    return reviews
```

### Stage 5: Final Analysis and Transcription
- **Purpose**: Generate final authoritative analysis and transcription
- **Model**: LLM4
- **Input**: All three Stage 4 comprehensive reviews
- **Output**: Final analysis and recommended transcription
- **Validation**: Content completeness and quality check
