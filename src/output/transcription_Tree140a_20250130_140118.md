## English Translation
**Postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy**

The spirit of harmonious relationships and the pursuit of righteousness was established by Guō Xiàngqīng (郭相卿), who commissioned the compilation from the literary world. Chén Kuí (陳魁) continued by setting the price with Qiū Lìng (邱令), and Chén Qiáokǒu (陳橋口) recorded his aspirations, which were realized by the efforts of his son, Bóshí (博實). To place the elders among the many and mix them with the present generation, without establishing separate lineages, but rather grouping them into one category. The abilities of the military advisor could be matched, and the talent of the prime minister should be selected for the Hanlin Academy. Listening to a melody from a faintly visible marketplace, ten matters are debated, and instruction is given. In the following text, the chosen words should be elegant, and within a single dynasty, the bloodline should be traced. By applying oneself to this, it will be completely beautiful and perfect. The day of auspiciousness may be like the Ming religion, but the present is still the root, and the ancient is still the present. What harm is there in comparing present people with the ancients? It is still an examination of pairs, and a restoration of reputations. There is loyalty and filial piety bound to descendants. The two words within are about responsibility. If there is a name paired with another name, it is appropriate to use words to indicate their surname. For each sentence, examine one matter, and it is appropriate to benefit from the investigation to seek the source. The collected information is abundant, and it is difficult to fit into a single style. If it must be said like this, then there would be days of stroking one's beard and fruitless carving of wood. Everyone bows and thanks him, saying that what is said is true. That's it, and it can compete with this for brilliance and be passed down to immortality. Indeed, it is an ancient saying; there are several profound writings about creation, that there are boundless blessings to reach the grandchildren, which is exactly what is meant. Everyone wants to obtain a copy as the light of their literary treasure, so that the unheard may be heard and the unseen may be seen. But the family lacks the expense for paper, a luxurious dwelling costs three coins each, and after diligent work, it will be completed by the strength of everyone’s efforts.

**Postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy**

When all under heaven share the same surname, they share the same ancestor. Dù Gōngbù (杜工部) said, "Those who dare to be of the same surname are good, because of this." Without a genealogy to record it, how can one discern the source and far-reaching journeys of the descendants? Historical records of the lineages of emperors show their origins after the Yellow Emperor, and many of the generations do not last three generations. It is believed that those who look at the genealogy later will trace their ancestors to see that they all came from the same source. It is understood that the Jade Lake Chen family genealogy, without the New Righteousness Pavilion, is full of wise people.

## Historical Commentary
Okay, let's delve into this fascinating postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy. This text is rich with historical, cultural, and social implications, and we can unpack them carefully.

**Individuals of Historical Significance**

*   **Guō Xiàngqīng (郭相卿):** While the text states he "commissioned the compilation from the literary world," this individual is not readily identifiable in well-known historical records. His significance is primarily within the context of this specific genealogy. He is the initiator, the one who had the vision to create this record of his clan. His importance lies in being the catalyst for the entire project. This suggests a certain level of status and literacy within the clan, as he had the means to engage "the literary world" for such a task.
*   **Chén Kuí (陳魁):** Like Guo Xiangqing, there is no readily available historical record of a person with this exact name who had a prominent place in Chinese history. His role is more practical: he "set the price" with Qiu Ling, indicating the financial and logistical elements of the genealogy's creation. This suggests a level of management and negotiation was involved. He is a key figure in the project's execution.
*   **Chén Qiáokǒu (陳橋口):** Similarly, this individual is not widely documented in history, but his role here is to record his "aspirations." This suggests an emotional and personal investment in the project, and he is the one who articulated the purpose and goals of the genealogy. His contribution is about the vision and meaning behind the document.
*   **Bóshí (博實):**  The son of Chen Qiaokou, Bóshí is crucial because he is the one who realized his father's aspirations. He completed the work, indicating a level of dedication and carrying on the family's intentions. His role is pivotal in bringing the project to fruition.
*   **Dù Gōngbù (杜工部):** This is a reference to **Du Fu (杜甫) (712-770 CE)**, a very famous and highly revered poet of the Tang Dynasty. He was often referred to as Dù Gōngbù (Duke Du of the Ministry of Works) due to a minor government position he held.  Du Fu's inclusion is significant. He is used as an example of a figure who emphasized the importance of shared ancestry and the bonds of clan identity. This quote is not directly from Du Fu's known works, but this use of a famous poet's name adds gravitas to the importance of clan ties. His inclusion elevates the importance of genealogy as a cultural endeavor.
*   **The Yellow Emperor (黃帝):** The Yellow Emperor is a legendary figure in Chinese mythology, considered a cultural hero and the ancestor of all Han Chinese people. He is a foundational figure in Chinese cultural and historical narratives. Mentioning him here reinforces the notion of shared ancestry and the importance of tracing back lineage to a common beginning. It also places the Chen clan within the larger historical and cultural context of China.

**Locations of Historical Significance**

*   **Jade Lake (玉湖):** This is the most important location mentioned. Without a specific context, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact Jade Lake. There are various bodies of water in China with similar names. However, its prominence in the genealogy's title indicates this is the ancestral home or the area where the Chen clan's lineage is primarily centered. This implies that the location is of special significance to the family, perhaps a place of origin, settlement, or historical importance to the Chen lineage.
*   **Hanlin Academy (翰林院):** The Hanlin Academy was an elite scholarly institution that served the imperial court in China. It was a center for learning, research, and literary activities, and it was where many important government officials were trained. Mentioning this institution suggests a desire for the Chen clan members to achieve intellectual and political success.
*   **New Righteousness Pavilion (新義閣):** The text states that the genealogy is "without the New Righteousness Pavilion," suggesting that this was a structure or institution that might have been associated with genealogical work. This may have been a place where genealogies were stored or consulted. The absence of this institution implies this particular genealogy is different from others, perhaps more focused on the lineage rather than external institutions.

**Unfamiliar Terms and Cultural References**

*   **"The literary world":**  This refers to the scholars, writers, and educated individuals who were engaged in intellectual pursuits. It indicates that the genealogy was not compiled by amateurs but by professionals who were skilled in writing and historical record-keeping.
*   **"Military advisor" and "Prime Minister":**  These are references to high-ranking officials in the imperial government, indicating that the genealogy aspires to document individuals of notable achievement. The text also suggests that the clan hopes that its members will reach high positions in society.
*   **"Hanlin Academy":** As mentioned above, this is a reference to the elite scholarly institution, indicating a desire for intellectual and political success for members of the Chen family.
*   **"Ming Religion":** This is a reference to the Manichaean religion, which was often linked to rebellions and resistance against imperial authority.  This is used as a metaphor for auspiciousness and the idea of a bright future, but it may also carry a subtle undertone of resistance or independence. It may also refer to the Ming Dynasty, which came to power by overthrowing the previous Yuan dynasty.
*   **"Stroking one's beard and fruitless carving of wood":** This is an idiom that means wasting time on pointless tasks. The author is suggesting that without a clear plan, the project would be a waste of time and resources.
*   **"Three coins":** This refers to the cost of a single copy of the genealogy, highlighting the practical financial considerations involved in its production. It also shows that this genealogy was meant to be distributed, not just kept in one place.
*   **"All under heaven share the same surname":** This is a common saying that emphasizes the shared ancestry of all Chinese people, particularly those with the same surname. It reinforces the idea of clan unity and shared identity.
*   **"Those who dare to be of the same surname are good, because of this":** This is the quote from Du Fu, which emphasizes the importance of shared ancestry and kinship. It implies that people with the same surname should be united and support each other.
*   **"Without a genealogy to record it, how can one discern the source and far-reaching journeys of the descendants?":** This statement emphasizes the purpose of a genealogy, which is to trace lineage and understand one's origins. It highlights the importance of knowing one's ancestry for cultural identity.
*   **"The day of auspiciousness":** Refers to the idea that the genealogy's completion was a positive and fortunate event, linking its creation with good fortune for the family.
*   **"Loyalty and filial piety bound to descendants":** These are core Confucian values, emphasizing the importance of loyalty to the emperor and respect for elders. The genealogy aims to instill these values in future generations.
*   **"Examination of pairs":** Refers to the practice of comparing present and past generations, to learn from and honor their ancestors. It's about understanding the continuity of the lineage.

**Date Conversions**

*   The text does not contain any specific dates, making date conversion impossible. The postscript focuses on the principles and process of creating the genealogy rather than specific time periods.

**Cultural and Social Context of the Time Period**

While the text doesn't give us precise dates, we can infer the general cultural and social context based on its content:

*   **Importance of Lineage:** The emphasis on genealogy and tracing ancestry demonstrates the importance of lineage in traditional Chinese society. Knowing one's ancestors was crucial for social identity, status, and understanding one's place in the world.
*   **Confucian Values:** The emphasis on filial piety, loyalty, and the importance of ancestors reflects core Confucian values prevalent in Chinese society for centuries. These values were central to family structure and social order.
*   **Literary Culture:** The involvement of "the literary world" and the concern with elegant language indicate a society that valued literacy and scholarship. This was a time when literary and intellectual pursuits were highly regarded.
*   **Aspiring to Excellence:** The mention of military advisors, prime ministers, and the Hanlin Academy reveals the ambition for the Chen clan to achieve success in both intellectual and political arenas. This is indicative of a society where social mobility was possible through education and achievement.
*   **Clan Identity:** The text underscores the importance of clan identity and the bonds that tied people together through shared ancestry and surname. Clan membership provided support, community, and a sense of belonging.
*   **Financial Considerations:** The mention of the cost of paper highlights the practicalities of producing a genealogy. This shows that while genealogy was valued, the financial aspects were also important and required careful planning.
*   **Aspirations for the Future:** The genealogy is not just a record of the past but also a tool for shaping the future. It aims to instill values, inspire achievements, and ensure the family's continued prosperity.

In conclusion, the postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy is a valuable document for understanding the social values, family structure, and cultural priorities of the time period in which it was written. It is a testament to the importance of lineage, the power of tradition, and the hopes and aspirations of the Chen family. It serves not just as a record of the past but also as a guide for the future, aiming to instill values, inspire achievements, and ensure the family's continued prosperity.
