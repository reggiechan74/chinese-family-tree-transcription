## English Translation
**Postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy**

The beauty of harmonious social interaction and upholding righteousness was achieved by Guo Xiangqing (郭相卿 *Guō Xiāngqīng*) who sought and compiled from the literary world, and Chen Kui (陳魁 *Chén Kuí*) who continued and finalized the pricing with Qiu Ling (邱令 *Qiū Lìng*). Chen Qiaokou (陳橋口 *Chén Qiáokǒu*) with his personal aspirations, then Bo Shi (博實 *Bó Shí*) with the work of his son, bought the major [manuscript]. It is still that many people are mixed together today. People do not establish clear lineages, and are grouped into one category. With the ability of a military counselor, they should be suitable for the position; with the talent of a prime minister, they should enter the selection for the Hanlin Academy. Listening to a tune, vaguely there, ten things are debated and pointed out.

The following words should be elegant, and the bloodline should be swiftly traced within a single dynasty. If one puts one's heart into this, then it will be perfectly beautiful and good. On the day of auspicious response, it might be like the Ming sect, but today it is still the root; the ancient is still like the present. If present people criticize and ancient people examine, what harm is there? It is still based on parallelism, and also restores reputation. Loyalty and filial piety are tied to descendants. The two words "pre-arranged" and "within" are from a broad responsibility. Dare to have one name paired with another name; it is appropriate to write the words and introduce the surname, each sentence outlining one matter. It is appropriate to use a harmonious tone to seek it. Since collecting from the wind is much, it is difficult to make it all of one style. If it must be said like this, then twirling one's beard will be a daily occurrence, and engraving on wood will be fruitless. Gentlemen, bow and thank them, saying what is true.

This is exactly this, and can compete with it to shine and be passed down to immortality. Indeed, there are ancient sayings, "Sinking has several chapters concerning creation, and there will be endless blessings that will reach the grandsons," which is exactly what is meant. Everyone wants to find a copy, to be the light of the literary mansion, to be heard where it has not been heard, and to be seen where it has not been seen. However, the family has no paper, and the cost of producing it is high, each volume costing three coins. After much effort, it will finally be completed, and I will again rely on the strength of you gentlemen.

**Postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy**

Opening the world to the same surname, they will have the same ancestor. Du Gongbu (杜工部 *Dù Gōngbù*) said: "Those with the same surname are square, and the brave are good." Because of this, if there is no genealogy to record it, how can its lineage be distinguished? And in the distant future, historical records will trace the lineage of emperors, showing that they came from the Yellow Emperor. There are many lineages, not just these three today. Believe that later generations who look at the genealogy will mostly follow the lineages, to see that they all come from one source, and it reaches far. The Jade Lake Chen family genealogy has no new meaning; under the eaves, all sit the virtuous.

## Historical Commentary
Okay, let's delve into this fascinating postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy. Here's a detailed academic commentary structured as requested:

**Individuals of Historical Significance**

*   **Guo Xiangqing (郭相卿 *Guō Xiāngqīng*)**: While the text identifies him as the compiler who "sought and compiled from the literary world," there is no readily available historical figure of significant national fame with this name. This suggests he was a local scholar or a member of the gentry, important within the context of the clan and its genealogy, but not a figure of broader national historical significance. His role as the initial compiler of the genealogy indicates his investment in preserving the clan's history and lineage.

*   **Chen Kui (陳魁 *Chén Kuí*)**: Similar to Guo Xiangqing, Chen Kui is not a prominent figure in broader Chinese history. However, his role as the one who "continued and finalized the pricing" suggests he was likely a figure of some authority within the clan, perhaps in charge of financial matters or the practical aspects of publication. His involvement highlights the collaborative nature of the project and the resources needed to bring it to fruition.

*   **Qiu Ling (邱令 *Qiū Lìng*)**: This person is also not a well-known historical figure. Their role in finalizing the pricing, along with Chen Kui, further emphasizes the financial and logistical considerations involved in creating a genealogy. These three individuals together represent the intellectual and practical leadership of the clan in this endeavor.

*   **Chen Qiaokou (陳橋口 *Chén Qiáokǒu*)**: This individual is again not a widely known historical figure. His contribution is described as having "personal aspirations," which may imply a personal investment in the project, likely tied to his own lineage within the Chen clan. His aspirations might be to ensure that his particular branch of the family is properly represented and remembered.

*   **Bo Shi (博實 *Bó Shí*)**: Similarly, there is no significant historical figure with this name. The text states that he "bought the major [manuscript]" with the work of his son. This action implies that he was a person of some means and influence within the clan. His purchase is a key aspect of the genealogy's production, suggesting that the project relied on the patronage of wealthy family members.

*   **Du Gongbu (杜工部 *Dù Gōngbù*)**: This is indeed a significant historical figure. Du Gongbu is the courtesy name of **Du Fu (杜甫, 712-770)**, one of the most revered poets in Chinese history. Du Fu lived during the Tang Dynasty and is known for his realism, social commentary, and mastery of poetic forms. His inclusion here is not because he was related to the Chen family but because the quote attributed to him ("Those with the same surname are square, and the brave are good") lends authority and a sense of tradition to the importance of recording genealogy. This quote, however, is likely an interpretation or paraphrase rather than an exact quote from Du Fu's works. It emphasizes the value of shared lineage and the positive qualities associated with it.

*   **The Yellow Emperor (黄帝 *Huángdì*)**: This is a legendary figure in Chinese mythology and is considered the ancestor of the Han Chinese. The postscript mentioning that "historical records will trace the lineage of emperors, showing that they came from the Yellow Emperor" highlights the ancestral reverence present in Chinese culture. It suggests that tracing one's lineage back to the Yellow Emperor is a common goal and a source of pride.

**Locations of Historical Significance**

*   **Jade Lake (玉湖 *Yù Hú*)**: The Jade Lake is the name of the specific branch of the Chen Clan, but this is unlikely to refer to a specific location of historical significance beyond the area where that particular branch of the family resided. Without further information, we can assume that this is a local place name and not a place of national importance.

*   **Hanlin Academy (翰林院 *Hànlín Yuàn*)**: This was a prestigious scholarly institution during imperial China. It served as a gathering place for the nation's most talented scholars and intellectuals. The mention of the Hanlin Academy in the text highlights the social aspirations and the value placed on scholarship during this period. It suggests that members of the Chen clan aspired to achieve scholarly success and potentially gain positions of influence within the government. It also underscores the importance of a well-documented family lineage as a possible avenue for social advancement.

**Unfamiliar Terms and Cultural References**

*   **"Pricing" (定價 *dìngjià*)**: This refers to the process of determining the cost of the genealogy project, particularly the cost of producing copies. It underscores the financial considerations involved in such a large undertaking, which often involved multiple individuals and a significant investment of resources.

*   **"Military counselor" (將佐 *jiāngzuǒ*) and "prime minister" (宰相 *zǎixiàng*)**: These terms refer to high-ranking positions in the imperial government. The text uses these terms to illustrate the potential for individuals with talent and ability to rise to positions of power and influence. It suggests that a clear lineage and the record of a family's history could potentially benefit members in their pursuit of official careers.

*   **"Ming sect" (明教 *Míngjiào*)**: This is a reference to a religious group associated with the historical Manichaean religion and is often mentioned in Chinese popular culture due to its portrayal in martial arts literature. Here it is used metaphorically to suggest a sense of shared belief and purpose, indicating the importance of the genealogy as a unifying force for the clan.

*   **"Parallelism" (對偶 *duì'ǒu*)**: This is a literary device common in Chinese prose and poetry where two phrases or clauses have similar grammatical structure and meaning. The text refers to the use of parallelism in the genealogy itself, suggesting a focus on elegant language and literary quality.

*   **"Engraving on wood" (木刻 *mùkè*)**: This refers to the method of printing using woodblocks, which was the primary printing technique in China before the advent of modern printing. The mention of "engraving on wood" highlights the labor-intensive nature of producing the genealogy. It suggests that the project was a significant undertaking requiring considerable effort and skill.

*   **"Three coins" (三錢 *sān qián*)**: This refers to the cost of each volume of the genealogy. The use of a specific monetary value provides insight into the economic context of the time and the value placed on such texts. It also highlights the financial challenges involved in making the genealogy widely available.

*   **"Under the eaves, all sit the virtuous" (簷下皆賢 *yán xià jiē xián*)**: This is a common Chinese saying that implies that those who reside within a family and share the same lineage are all virtuous and worthy. It emphasizes the importance of family unity and shared values.

**Date Conversions**

The text does not explicitly give any traditional Chinese dates.  Therefore, a Gregorian calendar conversion is not applicable. However, the text provides us with a wealth of information about the time period. The references to the Hanlin Academy, woodblock printing, and the use of traditional Chinese literary styles suggest that this text was likely written during the late Ming Dynasty or the Qing Dynasty, periods where these cultural and intellectual elements were prominent. The mention of Du Fu, a Tang Dynasty poet, is not an indication of the text's date of creation but highlights the importance of tradition and historical precedent in Chinese culture.

**Cultural and Social Context of the Time Period**

The postscript provides significant insight into the cultural and social context of the time:

*   **Emphasis on Lineage and Ancestral Veneration:** The entire project revolves around establishing and preserving the family lineage. This reflects the deep-seated importance of ancestry and filial piety in Chinese society. Genealogies were not mere records; they were powerful tools for maintaining social order, reinforcing family identity, and demonstrating continuity.

*   **Social Mobility and Aspiration:** The mention of the Hanlin Academy and government positions reflects the social mobility that was possible through education and meritocracy. However, access to education and official positions was often linked to family background, hence the importance of a well-documented genealogy.

*   **Importance of Scholarship and Literature:** The emphasis on elegant language, parallelism, and the reference to Du Fu illustrate the high value placed on scholarship and literary achievement in Chinese culture. The creation of a genealogy was not just a practical task but also a literary endeavor that required skill and refinement.

*   **Financial Considerations:** The discussion of pricing and the cost of production highlights the practical challenges involved in creating and distributing a genealogy. The project was clearly a collective effort that required financial contributions from multiple individuals.

*   **Collective Identity and Community:** The postscript emphasizes the idea that those with the same surname share a common ancestor and a shared identity. The genealogy served as a means of reinforcing this collective identity and fostering a sense of community among members of the Chen clan.

In conclusion, this postscript to the Jade Lake Chen Clan Genealogy is not just a historical document; it is a window into the values, beliefs, and social practices of a particular time and place in Chinese history. It reveals the importance of family, ancestry, scholarship, and social mobility within a traditional Chinese context. The individuals involved, while not well-known on a national scale, are crucial figures in the history of their clan, demonstrating the importance of local history and community identity.
